      <h4>Project development methodology:<h4>
      <p> This project will use agile for the main methodology of this project development. The Learning Management System (Glossary) principal is serving a well platform for the student and teacher to manage their own learning process. So we need customers or other software testers giving us feedback on bugs or anything problem or miss on the function. The first shippable product will include all basic things the development team can think about and  some survey results. This system will work as a modularized system. The basic system core will not be changing a lot according to the software update. Development team will release some add-on packets according to the feedback from the customer. Customers can choose whether they need or not. <p>
      <p>The main system no need to update frequently. The most frequently updated part is those modules. The module developer can be anyone. Anyone can develop their own module. But if the module developer wants to release and become one of the selectable modules on the system to let customers install, the developer needs to be sent it to us to review. This is the only way to release the module in the system. The project development team will test out the module and see whether the system already contains similar or the same module. We may do some modifying before releasing the module. The system development will make sure the module is stable and won’t cause any error between the main system. We will recommend the user select the module that is released by the system development team. The user also can download any non-official release module from the internet. But we are not recommended and won’t provide any support to the customer.<p>
